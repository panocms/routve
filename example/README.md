## Example Folder

Under this directory we have example use cases for `Routve`. Currently these examples are available:

- <a href="rollup-dynamic/">`rollup-dynamic`</a>: Dynamic import / code splitting with <a href="https://github.com/rollup/rollup">Rollup</a> bundler example. It's useful for people who would like to learn about code splitting (aka. dynamic component import) in Rollup bundler.

#### Upcoming Examples:

- `rollup`: Static import with <a href="https://github.com/rollup/rollup">Rollup</a> bundler. Does not support code splitting (aka. dynamic component import).
- `webpack`: Code splitting, dynamic and static component import with <a href="https://webpack.js.org">webpack</a> bundler. This example is for you if you are using webpack.
- `rollup-dynamic-hashbang`: Hashbang enabled and prepared links for hashbang support. It has same examples as `rollup-dynamic` except hashbang support enabled.

<strong>Note:</strong> All examples may not include all `Routve` features! Which means, for example; `rollup` example folder won't be showing `code splitting` (aka. dynamic component import) feature since `rollup` needs a special configuration for code splitting.
